        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Classic Italian Lasagna – layers of silky smooth, creamy parmesan béchamel sauce, a slow simmered Bolognese meat sauce, sheets of pasta, and lots of mozzarella cheese make this the World’s Best Lasagna recipe.</p>
            <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ragù sauce – a meat based Italian sauce for pasta with a base of sautéed onions, carrot, and celery and the addition of tomato.</li>
                    <li>Béchamel sauce – an easy to make white sauce. Simply whisk hot milk into a flour and butter. With parmesan for added cheesy flavor.</li>
                    <li>Lasagna noodles – fresh sheets or dried lasagna noodles.</li>
                    <li>Mozzarella – spread in between the layers and on top.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Chop the onion, carrot, and celery very fine. If it’s too big, it might not get soft enough in the sauce. I like to chop mine up in the food processor.
                        Sauté the chopped onion, carrot, and celery in butter and olive oil until it is soft and golden. Add the garlic and sauté another minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef and cook until brown, breaking it up into small pieces, and all of the liquid is absorbed.
                        Pour in a cup of milk and let simmer until the liquid is absorbed. (If I’m in a hurry, I skip this step, but it does mellow the flavor and add a silky texture to the sauce.)</li>
                    <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, bouillon cube, salt, pepper, sugar, and vinegar. Bring to a simmer. If I’m in a hurry, I allow it to simmer for about 30 minutes, however a long, slow 3 hour simmer is best if you have the time.
                        When the sauce is finished, it should be thick as shown here. If it has too much liquid, it will be messy when cut.
                        I like to stir in some chopped fresh basil when it’s done. This lightly dried basil from Walmart is pretty cool when it’s hard to get a hold of fresh basil. It stays fresh for 4 weeks after opening.</li>
                    <li>Cover the Lasagna with foil and bake for 20 minutes in a 375 F oven. After 20 minutes, remove the foil (and the sticks if using) and continue to bake for another 30 minutes until bubbly and the cheese on top starts to get brown spots.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
